**About Me**
I am currently pursuing a Master of Applied Econometrics at Monash University (expected graduation: December 2025). My thesis focuses on the Misspecification of Graphical Models.

Before beginning my Master’s, I worked as an SAP Functional Consultant at a consultancy in Pakistan, where I helped commercial banks implement SAP On-Premise and Cloud products. I provided support services to Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and contributed to the implementation of A/B testing and Predictive Modelling solutions for bankers. This experience sparked my decision to pursue a Master’s degree, as I became increasingly interested in the application of statistical models in business contexts.

In my spare time, I enjoy attending Toastmasters meetings, playing soccer, and reading.

My academic training has equipped me with expertise in Forecasting, Bayesian Statistics, Time Series Analysis, Panel Data Modelling, and Non-linear Regression. I am proficient in Matlab, R, and Python, and I use these tools to compute and implement statistical models.
