## 📊 Thesis Proposal Description My thesis is focused on understanding errors in how we model relationships between different variables, using a method called Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs).
At the heart of this, I’m working with Bayesian networks that show how variables are related to each other. These relationships are represented as "edges" or connections in the network. Normally, GGMs assume that the data follows a smooth, bell-shaped Normal distribution. These models are useful for understanding the conditional relationships between variables — meaning, how one variable is connected to another when you account for all the others.
The main question I'm exploring is: What happens if the data we're working with doesn't exactly follow the ideal Gaussian distribution?
## 🧪 Experiment Details
<br>•	Number of variables (p): 3</br> 
<br>•	Number of observations (n): 1000</br> 
<br>•	Bayesian Prior: Spike and Slab Prior</br> 
<br>•	Bayesian Likelihood:
  o	Gaussian distribution (mean = 0, variance = 1) under True conditions
  o	Misspecified Distribution 1: t-distribution (df = 5), mean = 0, variance = 1
  o	Misspecified Distribution 2: t-distribution (df = 3), mean = 0, variance = 1</br> 
<br>•	Red lines in histogram: Represent the Maximum Likelihood Point Estimate</br> 
<br>•	Tables: Marginal Posterior Estimates of the off-diagonals of a Precision Matrix and Diagonals</br> 
## 🔍 Key Finding in Proposal
Under a highly sparse Precision Matrix, increasing model misspecification tends to cause the likelihood estimates and marginal posterior probabilities to diverge more significantly from their true values.
